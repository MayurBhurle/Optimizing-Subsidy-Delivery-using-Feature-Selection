**RESUME POINTERS**



Optimizing Subsidy Delivery using Feature Selection;


◦	Optimized subsidy delivery model by identifying key features using univariate & bivariate analysis.


◦	Achieved 83% accuracy in predicting Salary Status with KNN and Logistic Regression.






**Problem Statement**



The core challenge in subsidy distribution lies in accurately identifying eligible beneficiaries.
Traditional methods often suffer from inefficiencies due to the inclusion of irrelevant features,
leading to misallocation of resources. Inaccurate predictions about salary status can result in
subsidies being granted to ineligible individuals or, conversely, withholding support from those who
genuinely need it. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine
learning model that optimizes subsidy delivery by identifying and focusing on the most relevant
features, thus improving prediction accuracy.
